    <b>The World Wide Web and HTML</b><br><br>
    HTML documents make up the world wide web. A person receives HTML documents
    via <em>HTTP</em> request sent to and from a <em>web browser</em>. Here is a link to a

    <b><em>L</em></b>anguage. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web.
    HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks".

    <br><b>Elements,Tags, and Attributes</b> <br><br>
    <p>HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by
    using HTML tags. Example below: <br><br>
    <b>Tags:</b> "b" tag (<b>bold</b>) or "em" tag (<em>italics or emphais</em>). Tags are made up of an open tag and a closed tag with some sort of
    contents between them. The contents that falls between the open and close tags is what the tags are being applied to.<br><br>
    <b>Attributes:</b> "a" (<b>anchor</b>) attribute is for creating links. This attribute is made up of the attribute name (<em>href</em>), value (<em>web address "www.google.com"</em>), and discripter word that will be highlighted indicating a link is present.
    <br><br>
    <b>Image:</b> "img" (<b>image</b>) tags are <em>VOID</em> tags, which means they don't have content. They are made up of <em>src</em> (source or location of saved image) and <em>alt</em> (alternate text to be displayed when image fails to load.
    </p>
    <p>White Space</b><br><br>
    White space is defined as all "blank" spaces, tabs, or returns. In HTML all white space is seen as a single space. A return line tag has to be used display multiple lines. Examples below:<br><br>
    <b>Return Line:</b> "br" (<em> break</em>) or "p" (<em>paragraph</em>). break tags are void tags, where paragraph tags are not void. This means break tags are only a signle tag (no open and close tag) and paragraph tags have and open tag, content, and a close tag.
    <br><br>
    <b>Inline/Block:</b> inline tags are inline with text(br). Block tags have contents and place a block or box around the contents that has both hight and width.    
    </p>
    <br>
    <b>Container Elements</b>
    <br><br>
    Container elements are elements with tags that contain a section of text inside HTML. Examples are below:
    <p><b>SPAN:</b> is an inline tag
      <br><br>
      <b>DIV:</b> is a block tag
    </p>
